/* Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 
Example 1:
  Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
  Output: true

Example 2:
  Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
  Output: false   */
